  "content": "Diaspora is mind-bending. The book opens with a highly detailed, low-level description of the birth of a synthetic mind: the beginning shadows of thought, the bootstrapping of consciousness. Citizens of The Diaspora create and occupy virtual worlds, clone and alter their minds, explore math, physics and the Universe(s)... Best sci-fi I've come across in any medium."
