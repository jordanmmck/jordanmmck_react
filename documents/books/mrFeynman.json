  "content": "Feynman was brilliant ⁠— he is my model for how to think independently, reason from first-principles, and doubt convention. His description of the world through the lens of physics ignited the love for physics which ultimately drove me to engineering. He was also famously eccentric ⁠— the stories of his adventures are hilarious."
