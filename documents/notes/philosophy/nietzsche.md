I’ve long been skeptical that Bitcoin would win out as future-money, but in light of the recent increase in pro-Bitcoin.

```js
const aaaa = 1;
const bbbb = 'string';
const cccc = `test${aaaa}`;
const dddd = true;
// comment
const function = (a, b) => {
  console.log(!aaaa >= bbbb);
  Date.now() * 100;
};
class x extends y {

}
```
